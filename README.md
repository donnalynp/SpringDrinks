# SpringDrinks
- ## Why are we doing this? <br/>
We are creating a Spring Boot API as the final project for the bootcamp.
- ## How I expected the challenge to go? <br/>
I expected the project to be more challenging as there is a lot of things to remember. I also thought that it would be harder to put the project on a repository on GitHub as this is something we have not practice very often but it has been less challenging than what I first thought to be. 
- ## What went well? / What didn't go as planned? <br/>
I run to some problems with mySQL table, I initially had ‘long’ as my data type for price and amount but later realised that I needed the price to be ‘double/decimal’ and amount to be a ‘’string so that I could add the measurement of the unit of the amount of the drinks (mainly litres). So, I had to modify the data type on mySQL workbench after changing it in my domain class. <br/>
Towards the end, when running the Controller Integration Test, I was having some errors, my table on mySQL was already created so the test wasn’t running. I had to add a new line in the fizzydrink-schema.sql file to drop the existing table so that I could run the test. In the end, I was able to overcome all these errors.
- ## Possible improvements for future revisions of the project. <br/>
Some possible improvements for future revisions of the project are:
  -	To increase the test coverage as it only goes up to 59.9%; with more practice I could try to get it up to 80% as a stretch goal.
  -	To make use of the Jira board from the start. – I created the Jira board and updated it all in the last day. It would have been more realistic if I had created   it on the first day of the project and updated it day by day as I was doing the project.
  -	To practice how to merge branches. – I had a branch called database that I wanted to merge with the dev branch, but I realised it wasn’t possible because I   originally created the databases branch from the main. At the end, I merged database with the main branch.
